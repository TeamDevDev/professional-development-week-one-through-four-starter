### Learning Objectives

TODO: Please refer to the Learning Objectives section of the course web site to review
the learning objectives for both Allegheny College and the Software Engineering course.

#### Give a learning objective that you have improved on since the during this module of the course

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain what you did to improve your knowledge.
When you are writing your response to this question, please follow this template:

When I was working on `fill in the name of a professional development task`, I
made a mistake when I `explain details about the mistake`.

I did not understand `explain what you did not understand`.

Now I know `explain what you know`.

I revealed the gap in my understanding by `explain what steps you took to
identify the gap`.

Now I know `explain what you now know`.

To demonstrate my improved understanding of this professional skill, I will
`explain what steps you will take now that you understand the learning
objective`.

#### Give a learning objective that connects to covered material but for which you must continue to work

TODO: Retype the learning objective and then explain what work you need to
complete so as to ensure that you can develop a mastery of the stated professional skill.

TODO: Provide a direct link to course web site section that describes the learning
objective so that it is clear you have read this section of the syllabus and
then correctly described the learning objective in your own writing.

#### Give a reference to the location of the course web site that contains the learning objectives

TODO: Include the URL on the course web site that directly links to the learning objectives

### Professional Development Précis

TODO: Use the following list to provide a URL for the three professional development
précis articles that you wrote as a part of this module:

## Professional Reflection and Action Items

### Assuming that the Department of Computer and Information Science had unlimited resources and that the course instructor had unlimited time, what is one way to improve the course that would at least double your overall ability to learn software engineering?

TODO: Please answer this question with at least one paragraph consisting of at least three sentences

### Bearing in mind that resources and time are inherently limited, customize your answer to the previous question so that it can be feasibly implemented for the upcoming academic semester

TODO: Please answer this question with at least one paragraph consisting of at least three sentences

### Find at least one way to improve the Developer Development web site and report it through the issue tracker

TODO: Please refer to the following web site when you are looking for improvements:
https://developerdevelopment.com/

You may find a link to the issue tracker at the bottom of every page on
the Proactive Programmers web site. For your reference, here is the direct link
to the GitHub issue tracker for the web site:
https://github.com/TeamDevDev/www.developerdevelopment.com/issues

Note as part of your completion of this question you need to create a new
issue in the issue tracker for the Developer Development web site. The course
instructor will take into account all suggestions during and, as appropriate,
make changes to the site in preparation for the next phase of the semester.

If it is not possible for you to find at least one small issue that you
